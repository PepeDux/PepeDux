## About me ðŸ‘‹


I am a programmer based in Novosibirsk, having recently graduated from college with a degree in Information Technology. I possess experience working with a technology stack that includes .NET, SQL, MSSQL, Unity, and Godot.

I am dedicated to continuous professional growth, actively learning new technologies and development methodologies, and ready to apply my knowledge and skills to solve complex problems and create high-quality software products. In my free time, I enjoy working on personal projects, which helps me stay updated on the latest trends and innovations in the IT industry.

If you need an enthusiastic and goal-oriented developer with a solid technical foundation and a drive for professional development, I am the person you're looking for.
